# A Mad Lib is a phrasal template word game that was created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price.

# The game is played by one player asking another player for a list of words to fill in the blanks of a story.

# The first player asks the second player for words to fill those gaps without revealing the context and then reads the story back adding in those words to the spaces. 

# The twist is that the word list must be chosen without knowing what the story is about, resulting in funny and often nonsensical stories.

# The combination of words is entirely up to the person playing, and therefore the stories can read like comedy gold. Who doesn’t love to read about the pink elephant who fetched a smelly carrot from the green motorcycle in the river, am I right? 

# Aside from the obvious hilarity that can ensue with an educational game like this, there is the added bonus of a lot of learning going on!

# The best k
# ind of learning is when the kids aren’t even aware it’s happening, and better still are enjoying it so much they regularly ask for it. You can’t ask for much more than that, especially from a game that only involves paper and a pen!
